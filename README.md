# Cybersecurity Networking Toolkit

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Networking Toolkit** – a curated collection of interactive web-based tools designed to simplify networking tasks for cybersecurity analysts and network engineers.

## 🔐 Why This Toolkit?
In cybersecurity operations, analysts frequently rely on subnetting, IP calculations, binary conversions, and firewall planning. These tasks, while routine, are prone to human error when performed manually. This repository automates those steps with visual, interactive tools that:

- Speed up calculations (binary ↔ decimal ↔ IP)
- Help design secure subnet plans
- Simplify documentation for IP ranges and usage
- Assist in incident response (knowing what subnet/IP belongs to what zone)

Whether you're handling alert triage, firewall rule reviews, or setting up segmentation for Zero Trust — this toolkit can help.

## 🧠 For Cybersecurity Analysts
If you're a SOC Analyst, Threat Hunter, or working in GRC/Incident Response, these tools will help you:
- Plan detection zones logically
- Document network scopes per team/system
- Avoid subnet overlap in segmentation
- Respond faster by identifying which subnet was hit during incidents

> **Made by analysts, for analysts.**
